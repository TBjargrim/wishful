## Project description

The website is a project we worked on as a school project.

Have you also stood empty-handed for an hour before the set time for a party, felt the stress and thought:

- What should I buy with me?
- What is suitable to buy for this particular person?
- Wondering what he wants?

If you could get a reminder, not only for when the person turns one but also when it's time to buy a gift and feel free to get suggestions on what to buy.

This idea was developed to become a reminder web page that helps users remember birthdays / anniversaries or the like. On the website you can see your friends '/ family members' wish lists, when they turn one or celebrate an anniversary.
