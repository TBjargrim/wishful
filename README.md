This web application is our final project during our time at KYH, an university of applied sciences.

We have built this using Next.js, Sass for styling, Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage.

## Project description


The application helps the users to remember friends and familymembers birthdays and other important days to celebrate.

They do so by following their friends, to get access to all the dates the friend has marked on their homepage. The user will get those days marked in their calendar in the application and a reminder will show up one week before the event or day takes place.

The user also get access to the wishlists that their friends provides to their homepage.

With all of these advantages you will never forget a birthday, forget to buy a present in time and never buy the wrong gift.

##  Future development
We want to develop these functions:

 - The ability to link to another website for buying the items in the wishlist
 - Customize the dates for the users events and make it more flexible to use
 - Add the ability to check of an item in a friends wishlist to indicate is has been bought, without the wishlists owner seeing it.
